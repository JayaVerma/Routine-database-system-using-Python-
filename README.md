# Routine-database-system-using-Python
The frontend.py contains the main GUI of the project with all the labels, title, buttons, input boxes, a list box and the functions which command each of the buttons in the frontend part.
We also have a backend where all the connection made between database stored.
The backend.py connects the frontend to the database(Here we are using sqlite3) where all the data get stored. Each of the functions defined in the backend.py fetch the required set of the data stored in the database(database name: routine) and return it to the function called.
